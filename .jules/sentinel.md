## 2024-05-05 - [CRITICAL] Prevent Unicode-based homograph attacks in identifier validation
**Vulnerability:** The application was using `char::is_alphanumeric()` to validate plugin names and repositories. This Rust method allows all Unicode alphanumeric characters, meaning names with Cyrillic or Greek characters could pass validation.
**Learning:** `char::is_alphanumeric()` in Rust is not ASCII-restricted and can lead to homograph attacks, where an attacker registers a plugin with a visually identical name using non-ASCII characters.
**Prevention:** Always use `char::is_ascii_alphanumeric()` when validating system identifiers, URLs, or file paths where you expect standard ASCII characters.
